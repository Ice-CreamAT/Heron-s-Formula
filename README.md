# Heron's Formula

This program will take two triangles and calculate the largest area between them, however, without using classes.

Heron of Alexandria was a great mathematician who derived the formula for the calculation of the area of a triangle using the length of all three sides. He also extended this idea to find the area of quadrilateral and also higher-order polygons. This formula has its huge applications in trigonometry such as proving the law of cosines or the law of cotangents, etc.

According to Heron, we can find the area of any given triangle, whether it is a scalene, isosceles or equilateral, by using the formula, provided the sides of the triangle.

# Proof of Heron’s Formula

There are two methods by which we can derive Heron’s formula:

First, by using trigonometric identities and cosine rule.

Secondly, solving algebraic expressions using the Pythagoras theorem.
Let us see one by one both the proofs or derivation.
